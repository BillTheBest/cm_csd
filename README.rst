CDAP Custom Service Descriptor (CSD)
====================================

The CDAP Custom Service Descriptor (CSD) is an extension for Cloudera Manager allowing it to install
and manage CDAP services.  It consists of a service descriptor SDL and a control script, which together
are responsible for configuring and launching CDAP services.

Cloudera's documentation for CSDs can be found `here <https://github.com/cloudera/cm_ext/wiki/CSD-Overview>`__.

Full documentation for installing the CDAP services via Cloudera Manager can be found `here <http://docs.cdap.io/cdap/current/en/integrations/index.html>`__.
